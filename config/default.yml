  # What version of Rails is the inspected code using?  If a value is specified
  # for TargetRailsVersion then it is used.  Acceptable values are specificed
  # as a float (i.e. 5.1); the patch version of Rails should not be included.
  # If TargetRailsVersion is not set, RuboCop will parse the Gemfile.lock or
  # gems.locked file to find the version of Rails that has been bound to the
  # application.  If neither of those files exist, RuboCop will use Rails 5.0
  # as the default.
